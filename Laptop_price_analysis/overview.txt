Laptop Price Analysis

This project explores the relationship between laptop specifications and their market prices using data analytics and machine learning. The goal was to develop a predictive model that estimates the price of a laptop based on its technical features. This combines financial analysis, data science, and machine learning techniques to draw meaningful insights from structured product data.


Objective

To build a regression-based machine learning model capable of predicting laptop prices by analyzing key specifications such as processor type, RAM, storage, screen resolution, and other hardware characteristics.


Tools and Technologies

Languages and Platforms: Python, SQL, Excel

Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn

Development Environment: Jupyter Notebook, VS Code

Domain Focus: Data Analysis, Financial Modeling

Project Level: Advanced



Dataset Description

The dataset contains information on 1,275 laptops and includes 23 features such as brand, screen size, operating system, processor frequency, storage type, and GPU details. The target variable is the laptop price in Euros. The data was preprocessed to remove duplicates, handle formatting issues, and extract useful features for analysis.
 


Approach and Methodology

1. Data Preprocessing

Cleaned the data and removed duplicate entries

Converted categorical features using one-hot encoding

Handled missing values to ensure data integrity



2. Exploratory Data Analysis

Conducted univariate and bivariate analysis using bar charts, pie charts, scatter plots, and box plots

Analyzed how specifications such as touchscreen, Retina display, and storage type influence laptop prices



3. Feature Engineering

Transformed complex columns (like CPU and screen specs) into more usable formats

Separated primary and secondary storage attributes for clarity



4. Model Building

Used Linear Regression as a baseline model to predict laptop prices

Evaluated model performance using Mean Squared Error and R-squared metrics



5. Results Visualization

Created scatter plots to compare actual versus predicted prices

Highlighted trends and pricing patterns across brands and configurations


Key Takeaways

Laptops with touchscreens, high RAM, SSDs, and higher CPU frequencies tend to have higher prices.

Apple devices form a distinct pricing cluster compared to other brands.

Storage configuration, screen size, and GPU model significantly affect price.


Future Enhancements

Implement advanced models such as Random Forest, XGBoost, or Support Vector Regression for improved accuracy.

Incorporate cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning.

Merge with external price trend data for real-time predictive capability.
